# Phase 2 - Gradient Descent Lab (Chapter 2)

This folder captures the Chapter 2 findings and a concrete implementation plan
for expanding the Perceptron Visual Lab into a Gradient Descent Lab. The core
thesis from Chapter 2 is:

"Gradient descent works because it uses the full gradient vector in the full
parameter space. Many confusing pictures (local minima, wormholes) are artifacts
of looking at low-dimensional slices of a high-dimensional loss surface."
